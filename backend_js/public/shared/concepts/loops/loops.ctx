Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could add the action once, and repeat it multiple times?", "<span class='inlineBold'>Iteration</span> allows to do exactly this.", "<p class='defBox'>Iteration allows us to simplify our algorithm by stating that we will repeat certain actions a given number of times.</p>", "<b>What is the difference between a loop and iteration?</b>", "A loop is an element of a program which uses iteration to repeat a block of code a particular number of times. On the other hand, iteration is simply the process of repeating the code block.", "As you will see in the next section, it is possible to specify that the loop should continue until a certain condition is met. In this section, however, you will simply need to specify the number of times you wish to repeat the block of code."],
