## Login Page

Simple - google like, that's good. Intuitive

Logo: image matches well with the name. Colours somewhat muted. Minimalist. She likes. For students: adequate but not blowing them away

## Class Management Screen

Minimalist and functional. Clear.

Ability to remove students.

Would expect to get several fields in the class block to allow the teacher to add a student (when press add member button)

Happy that banner is uncluttered, thinks good choice of colourscheme

## Level Selection

Her initial opinion: for selecting levels within concepts.

Want headings to directly correspond to national curriculum headings. This would make it particularly easy to interpret. Use language from curriculum

## Level Intro

Concept description will fail to capture attention of students. They'll zone out. Split description into bullet points - students can read them outloud to class. Avoid paragraphs. Keep the tone and the info but present in more accessible layout. Be wary of words used ("tedious")

Teacher would possible expect a button you can click on to get teacher notes. However, base screen should be identical to what student sees

Hints: have the more generic hints (what to do when your stuck) first.

Image fits about right

Loves the banner and the lack of distractions.

Could benefit from the background grey box similar to the login page. Something to add a little more structure/page border (but without hard lines). Take inspiration from the login page

## Level

Loves the eye movement

Tried to click the level itself a lot before getting the hang of it. Perhaps make run button clearer. Struggled to find out what to do

Need an introductory level that introduces how to use the app. Teachers can use this to get used to the idea

What is the objective: place the bolts somewhere. Need to make it clearer that you need to eat them. Could make bolts spin or turn as visual cue that you need to interact with them. 

Could do with having the objective stated on the level intro page.

Enjoyed playing around with the levels

Could have score counter or banner showing how many bolts you've eaten. Would be useful 

Appreciated that the buttons are spartan, it's similar to the applications that you'll be using. Would be good to mimick the interfaces of common programming tools in the game. 

Would be good to have a play around phase where the student can experiment with blocks to see what happens, followed by a practical attempt to do it in one.

## Levels and Concepts

Used MyMaths and MangaHigh. On them, very easy for teacher to allocate work on individual and class level.

Want it to be easy to use

Really useful to view student solutions. It would be good to have a portal for the teacher to write feedback to the student on specific levels, that they could then view on the student side
