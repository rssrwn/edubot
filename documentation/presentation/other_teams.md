# PinIt

The team opened with personal stories of theirs + personas but didn't mention either during the demonstration. The RCA wanted more interweaving.

The team presented the problem and then presented their app as a solution, but the app was presented by name with a few bullet points. RCA thought it would be better to have the logo, branding and maybe a snapshot of the app.

Their system architecture map was typical, front end - backend - database. It didn't attract criticism (nor praise)

They made diagrams showing 2 alternatives for technologies they considered then justified which they went for (was pretty good).
