So let's imagine Mark has just started his Key Stage 3 computing course. His school would sign him up to the EduBot platform via this screen.

(Reveal prefilled signup page. Press enter to sign mark up. Taken to login screen.)

In his first computing lesson, not knowing what to expect and also not expecting much, he'll sign in, and be taken straight to our levels page.

(Login, taken to levels page).

Here Mark is presented with a variety of programming concepts, starting with the basics and steadily increasing in difficulty. Before getting started with the game, he would be guided by Nancy to follow the learn more link here.

(Click learn more link, taken to concepts page)

So Mark will of course spend most of his time with EduBot playing levels, but to aid him in learning more about the broader programming context and concepts, we present him a concept introduction page for each topic.

These are based off of the language and specification points from the National Curriculum. We received some feedback from Lucy, our teacher tester, who said it would be helpful if the site used the language and structure of existing resources, the introductory text and key points at the top draw on BBC BiteSize's computing resources.

Previously, this page was mostly just text, and Lucy suggested making it more visual - so we included highlighting and separations for key concepts, a table of the new programming blocks available, and a preview, showing an example program in action

(Click back to levels link.)

So let's get started with an actual level! Currently there is only one available, the tutorial:

(Click tutorial play button)

The level intro screen shows the key information about this level, stating objectives, which blocks are available and a preview of the level.

(Click try level)

And here we are! Mark will follow EduBot's tutorial, allowing him to get used to how the visual platform works. It was an entertaining but enlightening part of user testing when we gave EduBot to users without telling them how to use it. They would fumble around, not knowing which parts of the screen to click. So we added this tutorial to guide them.

(Drag blocks, press green triangle, restart)

We added a facility for hints to help him in those moments of frustration when he may be stuck. Once he is happy, he may continue to connect the pieces and finish the level. He receives some feedback on his performance, which we'll return to later.

So, we've had a look at Mark's experience with EduBot, but what about Mark's new teacher Nancy.
