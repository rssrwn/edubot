So let's imagine Mark has just started his Key Stage 3 computing course. His school would sign him up to the EduBot platform via this screen.

(Reveal prefilled signup page. Press enter to sign mark up. Taken to login screen.)

In his first computing lesson, he will sign in and be taken to the levels page.

(Login, taken to levels page).

Here Mark is presented with a variety of programming concepts. Under each concept, there are several incrementally more difficult levels to test his understanding. His new teacher, Nancy, would guide him to learn more about the first concept.

(Click learn more link, taken to concepts page)

So Mark will of course spend most of his time with EduBot playing levels, but to aid him in learning more about the broader programming context and concepts, we present him a concept introduction page for each topic.

These are based off of the language and specification points from the National Curriculum. We received some feedback from Lucy, our teacher tester, who said it would be helpful if the site used the language and structure of existing resources, the introductory text and key points at the top draw on BBC BiteSize's computing resources.

Previously, this page was mostly just text, and Lucy suggested making it more visual - so we included highlighting and separations for key concepts, a table of the new programming blocks available, and a preview, showing an example program in action

(Click back to levels link.)

So let's get started with an actual level! Currently there is only one available, the tutorial:

(Click tutorial play button)

The level intro screen shows the key information about this level, stating objectives, which blocks are available and a preview of the level.

(Click try level)

And here we are! Mark will follow EduBot's tutorial, allowing him to get used to how the visual platform works. It was an entertaining but enlightening part of user testing when we gave EduBot to users without telling them how to use it. They would fumble around, not knowing which parts of the screen to click. So we added this tutorial to guide them.

(Drag blocks, press green triangle, restart)

We added a facility for hints to help him in those moments of frustration when he may be stuck. Once he is happy, he may continue to connect the pieces and finish the level. He receives some feedback on his performance, which we'll return to later.

So, we've had a look at Mark's experience with EduBot, but what about Mark's new teacher Nancy.

(Login as teacher)

So when Nancy logs in to her portal she'll be taken to the class management screen. This is where EduBot diverges from the likes of codecademy on the teacher side. She can start setting up her year 7 class

(Press Add Class, type Year 7)

And she can add Mark to the new class

(Add Member, type Mark's username) 

Nancy can then view Mark's progress and where he's gotten to with the exercises.

I'll now hand over to Julien to demonstrate a later level and some of the interaction between students and teachers.

Let's now log in using Emily's profile.

(Click log out, login as Emily)

She's gotten further through the game, so we'll play level 6.

(Click level 6, click try level)

Here's the current state of her progress, we'll push play and see her score.

She realises that solution isn't optimal, so she takes a look at the level introduction by clicking on the intro button.

(Click intro)

It seems like we need take better advantage of loops in order to use fewer blocks, so let's go back to playing the level and improve Emily's solution.

(Click try level, take all but first 2 blocks in first loop out, separate into 3)

If we now take these blocks out, we can separate them and see that there is some duplication. In this case, we should use a loop to repeat these actions twice.

(Combine common code into loop)

Let's see how efficient our solution is.

(Click play)

Great, we got 3 stars.

Now, we're going to switch back to the teacher side and give Emily some feedback.

(Click log out, login as teacher)

Emily is in Year 9, let's go to her student page and view her progress.

(Click Emily)

Wonderful, Emily completed level 6 with 3 stars.

(Click level 6)

Let's first take a look at the sample solution.

(Click sample solution)

Wow, it uses nested loops. We'll see how Emily's solution compares.

(Click intro, click student solution)

Let's give her some feedback for her excellent work.

(Click feedback, type "Excellent solution! Keep up the good work, Emily.")

(Click submit feedback)

--

On Emily's side, we can now see this feedback by going to the level.

(Click log out, login as Emily)

It seems like she received some feedback, let's see what it says.

(Click level 6, click try level, click feedback)

Emily is very proud of herself, she done some good work.

I'll now pass it over to Harry, who's going to talk you through the more technical aspects of our project.
