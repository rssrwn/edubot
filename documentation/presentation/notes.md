# 5 Minute Opening Pitch

## Problem Statement

- Teachers and students struggling to keep up with new curriculum
- We're having ICT and science teachers forced to teach computing **picture of sighing/frustrated teachers/students**
- The changes most drastically affect key stage 3 students and non-computing teachers, making computing courses compulsory and impacting students and their choices as they transition to GCSE

Existing solutions:
- On the teacher side we envisage Nancy - chemistry teacher, struggling to teach computing, persona, moodogram specifically pointing out failings of existing systems
- Don't provide facilities for teachers to give feedback or review student solutions
- On the student side we see students like Mark who may be forced to take computing due to the new curriculum, despite not being particularly interested.
- With existing solutions, Mark is left to do a lot of the work independently
- Programming not very intuitive/heavy syntax, platforms like codecademy may fail to engage, particularly because computing now compulsory. **screenshot showing codecademy and its failings**

We now present you EduBot - the visual programmatic learning environment for key stage 3 students and teachers.
- EduBot gives a clean intuitive interface to students
- Introduces the core programming concepts in a concise and visual way, using a programming game format where students apply the concepts to help a robot complete objectives **demo play page**
- Teachers can track the progress of students throughout the concepts, view their solutions (as well as sample solutions to aid understanding) and provide feedback to the students **demo feedback**
