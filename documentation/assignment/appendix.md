## Personas:
 - Nancy, 34, Chemistry teacher. Nancy has recently been asked to teach programming
   to Key Stage 3 students due to the new curriculum and a shortage of skilled
   Computer Science teachers. She has been given access to the IT suite each week
   and is looking for an intuitive digital tool to help her get the key programming
   concepts across to her students.

 - Mark, 12, student. Mark is not particularly interested in technology (he enjoys
   Biology and wishes to study Medicine at university), however as part of the English
   curriculum he is required to attend a class teaching many of the core
   Computer Science concepts. Mark wants an engaging learning platform that
   does not require any prior knowledge of programming while still teaching him
   everything he needs to know.

## Stakeholder Map:
