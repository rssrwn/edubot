# 1 License

Seems ok

# 2. Def of Software

Seems ok

# 3 Permitted Use

Restricts use for commercial purposes. Likely violates freedoms. "Must be available for commercial use"

Violates:
- 0. Does not allow use for commercial purposes (which is a valid purpose under freedom 0).
- We initially felt it violated 2 and 3; however, it limits use of the software for commercial purposes but does not explicitly restrict distribution of the software.

# 4 Copyright and distribution

- 2 is violated by "not allowed to sell this “Software” or any part of it." Limits how you may distribute. Then explicitly disallows distributing original or modified form, fully violating freedoms 2 and 3. Does allow sharing with colleagues, mitigates problem slightly

Violates 3 as not allowed to distribute whole thing

Potentially violates everything violated by 5 ???

# 5 Modifications

First paragraph violates freedom 1. Limits how you may change the program. We are assuming that this definition of a modification applies in Point 4, so you would not be allowed to modify your personal copy into its own working model.

The freedoms allow requirements like those in the second paragraph

Second to last violates freedom 3. As you should not be required to notify anyone when you make or distribute a change.

Last paragraph, places limitations on distribution and usage of independent new components. Violating the principles of the freedoms

Last paragraph, terms of original agreement must be used. Hence, violates the freedoms that the document as a whole violates. Enforces that your code must be free, possibly violating freedom 3 - perhaps you need to charge in order to distribute

# 6

Does not explicitly violate the freedoms as they refer to software and not publications. However, one of the tenets of the four freedoms is that you may make modifications without notifying the original creators, so the requirement to notify the creators upon publication may violate this idea (that is presented under freedom 3).

# 7

Let's come back to this

# 8 Fees

Fine

# 9 Proprietary Rights

# 10 Warranty

Fine

# 11 Limitation of Liability

Fine

# 12 Support/Modifications


# 13 Controlling Law and Severability

We take the use of "shall" in "This license shall be governed by [...] Germany" to be making the export control regulations of the software part of the license. This may jeopardise the principles of the freedoms. It is intended that, though the licenses are subject to the laws of their region, those laws are not enforced in the license itself.

Implicitely captures violations of the freedoms in other parts of the document, when those parts are enforceable.
