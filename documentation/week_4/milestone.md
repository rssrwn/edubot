## User Feedback and Actions Taken

### First Iteration (last week's feedback)

It would be useful to have the ability to provide feedback to the students:
- Added a feedback function for teachers. They can view student solutions and utilise a feedback box. Students can now see when feedback is available and view it.

It's a bit difficult to figure out how to use the blocks and the program initially:
- Added a tutorial to the first level, showing students how to drag and connect blocks and run EduBot.

### Second Iteration (mid week feedback)

The level intro screen is still quite dense:
- Separated into different screens. New concept screen introduces the ideas, the blocks and how to use them.
- Level intro screen shows just the blocks for that level and multiple objectives (at least one describing the learning objective and one describing the goal in the level).

EduBot seems a little too mechanical:
- Tried a different design and got Lucy to show it to some of her students.
- They felt it looked a little too much like a bird, and commented that they thought it was odd that EduBot teleported when moving from square to square.
- We added interpolated movement and rotation complete with small amounts of acceleration to make EduBot seem more solid and real.

### Third Iteration (end of week feedback)



## Objective Evaluation

At the end of each day, we selected 3 arbitrary people (never choosing the same person twice) in the labs and asked them to create an account and complete levels 1-3 on EduBot. We then computed the average for each group and ended up with the following data:
* Monday: 3 min 20s
* Tuesday: 3 min 40s (added tutorial)
* Wednesday: 3 min 20s
* Thursday: 3 min

## Cover Story Mock-up

### More Key Stage 3 students are meeting the requirements for the new Computing curriculum due to a new educational tool for learning programming, EduBot

A group of four students at Imperial College London have developed an educational programming tool that focuses on teaching the core concepts in England's new Computing curriculum. Instead of bogging students down in the unintuitive syntax of many programming languages, EduBot introduces concepts through a simple block-based interface that many students find to be more engaging. Teachers are very pleased with this new tool as it allows them to track the progress of students and give feedback on their solutions, a feature lacking in many other educational tools.
