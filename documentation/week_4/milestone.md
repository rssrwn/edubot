### More Key Stage 3 students are meeting the requirements for the new Computing curriculum due to a new educational tool for learning programming, EduBot

A group of four students at Imperial College London have developed an educational programming tool that focuses on teaching the core concepts in England's new Computing curriculum. Instead of bogging students down in the unintuitive syntax of many programming languages, EduBot introduces concepts through a simple block-based interface that many students find to be more engaging. Teachers are very pleased with this new tool as it allows them to track the progress of students and give feedback on their solutions, a feature lacking in many other educational tools.
