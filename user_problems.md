Teacher:
- May need to teach new computing curriculum but not have a technical background
- Wants a tool that the students can engage with and that teaches them the full range of programming concepts from the curriculum
- May need support in understanding the concepts
- Would appreciate if students were supported without teacher intervention
- Wants to be able to set assignments for the class to cover specific topics
- Wants to be able to evaluate student success and progress with the tasks and view their solutions
- To support the assessment, could do with teacher oriented advice on what a good solution might look like and what students may struggle with

Need:
- A screen for adding concepts and levels to an assignment for the class/a student
- A screen describing to the teacher the topic and motivation of the level, describing common student pitfalls and problems
- Feedback from Lucy said that having hints that the students can view in level would be helpful. So have a screen/button/popup for hints
- A screen where the teacher can see each student's current score and level
- If the teacher clicks on the student, they will be taken to a screen showing the student's scores on each level.
- Clicking on the level shows the student's solution along with a side panel reminding the teacher what to expect from good solutions and describing common pitfalls
