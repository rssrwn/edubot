# Basic Idea

Bills notification service geared towards students and young adults (people with lots of email spam, busy, new to bills, possibly not the most organised).

clutter-free
move to different folder when paid
notify for direct debits

Bills:
- Gas and electricity
- Internet
- Phone
- TV license
- Subscriptions - Netflix, Amazon prime, etc...
- Rent

## Ideas

User accounts, set up with your full name + address. Can log in with email address.

Custom and configurable expenses like rent:
- Must be able to set up new expenses, with specific periodic payment dates and amounts

In-app notifications:

### Payments

Group payments:
- You and your flatmates sharing the bills
- Link yours and their accounts in some way
- Pool together the money and pay as one
- Make a group, invite people to it. Add bills to the group

Arbitrary expenses:
- Household supplies (toilet roll, washing up liquid, shared consumables)

Have two systems:
- One off payments:
  - 
- Direct debits:
  - The account lets you manage multiple direct debits all in one place
