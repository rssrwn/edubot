# Problem Statement

**Jordan**

Are students in key stage 3 engaged with programming? The answer is no, with the UK government investing millions in computing education but teachers struggling to keep up with the new curriculum. There are a variety of tools that attempt to teach programming, but many of them fail to capture the attention of students and more fail to give them a meaningful appreciation for the discipline.

To address this problem, we present you EduBot - the puzzle game teaching programmatic concepts interactively.

Current solutions are often too simple, failing to introduce students to algorithms or high level techniques. Another pitfall of otherwise great tools, such as Scratch, is that they provide an environment for programming but little direction.

With EduBot, we improve on these problems by gradually introducing concepts starting from the basics and progressing through to algorithms, data structures and object orientation (all important elements of high level programming). This is wrapped up in a visual package where the student programs a robot to overcome challenges in grid-based levels.

# Target Audience and User Groups

**Ross**

The main focus of our web app is the digital education sector, predominantly targeting schools and key stage 3 teachers.

We see two main groups using the app:
- Teachers will use it to organise classes and track student progress.
- And students will interact with it to learn the core concepts of programming.

# Mock Ups

(mention how interfaces satisfy the needs of the user groups)

For students we have:
- Landing page - has login and signup buttons
- Concept introduction page - shows active challenge. Description and wider context of challenge + examples of the techniques used.
- Challenges consist of a level and an interface for combining code blocks into programs visually.
- Student's progress through the class exercise and their performance shown on selection screen.

For teachers we have:
- Class management page - allows setup of different classes
- Class progress page gives macro view of most recent challenge sets
- Student progress shows where individual students are
- Class editor allows members to be added to a class

Footnotes:

Teacher:
- Interface for teachers to track student progress and scores.
- Teacher can set specific challenges for the class.

Students:
- Access teacher assigned challenges
- Visual interface for building behaviours for the robot - move, rotate, ifs, loops, functions, etc...

# Conclusion

**Jordan**

To wrap up, EduBot provides a platform for teachers to engage their students with programming and the important ideas behind it. We are confident that it will overcome the issues we have observed in existing solutions.
