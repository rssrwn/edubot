# Teachers

## Questions

- Are there any teachers with a computer science degree or training in your school?
- How much experience do you have programming?
- What tool(s) are you currently using to teach programming in your classroom?
- How well are students progressing with the new curriculum?
- What features would help you teach programming in an interactive way?

## User Feedback

### Users

- Lucy Glanfield (secondary school maths/science teacher)
- Mary Vaughn (secondary school science teacher)

### Answers

- Lucy says that because of the new curriculum, some teachers have been upskilled but there aren't any formal computer science teachers.
- Mary says there's one formal computer science teacher but too much demand so other teacher who aren't trained have to teach some classes.

- Lucy has taught computer science in the past but doesn't have any experience.
- Mary has very limited experience.

- Many teachers are using BBC Bytesize as a resource, and Codecademy and Scratch to teach the fundamentals.

- It's difficult to teach students what the curriculum expects, especially with limited experience from the teacher's side.
- They'd like to be able to set assignments to track students' progress, and view their solutions for each one.

- The teachers said they would like to have a well-described example solution and help in understanding the concept.

### Additional Feedback

- It be helpful to have a platform that teaches the full range of concepts from the curriculum.
- Students should be able to learn some of the material without teacher intervention.

# Students

- What features would make it more enjoyable to learn?

## User Feedback

### Users

- Mark Atkinson (11 years old)
- Dorothy Gray (13 years old)

### Answers

- Mark has no prior experience.
- Dorothy has used Codecademy to learn Python.

- Mark isn't particularly interested but is still learning.
- Dorothy doesn't understand some of the more complex concepts and wishes that there were a better learning platform.

- Mark thinks a more visual platform would make it more engaging.
- Dorothy wishes there were a platform to help her understand some of the more challenging concepts.

# Other Data Sources

## Questions

- What content and how are other programming learning platforms teaching (BBC Bytesize, Codecademy, Scratch)?
- What does the new curriculum expect students to learn?

## Results

- BBC Bytesize is a good hub for all of the material from the curriculum but isn't engaging and interactive for learning programming.
- Codecademy teaches written-based programming, which we found from user feedback can be offputting to people with little experience.
- Scratch is interactive and engaging but cannot teach on its own, it is simply a visual platform teachers can use to give examples when teaching concepts.

- The curriculum encapsulates the following concepts:
  - Alogithms (sorting, searching, ...)
  - Boolean logic
  - Number representation in binary
  - Data structures (lists, tables, arrays, ...)
  - Prodecures/functions

# Conlusions

- We need the following features:
  - A screen for adding concepts and levels to an assignment for the class
  - A screen describing to the teacher the topic and motivation of a level, describing common student pitfalls and problems
  - Hints that the students can view in levels, accessible via a screen/button/popup
  - A screen where the teacher can see each student's current score and level, as well as their solution and score for each level
  - A side panel reminding the teacher what to expect from good solutions and describing common pitfalls
